About XML
XML - extensible markup language
    designed to store and transport data
    designed to carry data not to display data
    we have to design our own tags
    platform and language independent

    key difference between HTML and XML
    html - used to display data
    XML - used to transport data
    html - pre-defined tags
    xml - no pre-defined tags

    metadata is stored as attribute and data is stored as element
